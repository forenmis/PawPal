# PawPal
Android  Pet Project for pet owners will help you organize the care of your pets. Create reminders for regular procedures such as vaccinations, parasite treatment, and vet appointments, so you never forget important moments. Keep a record of your pets' health and behavior to track their progress and notice any changes.

Our app also offers a convenient quick access feature where you can add your favorite pet supplies. Whether it's their favorite food, toys, or grooming products, you'll always have a handy shopping list.
